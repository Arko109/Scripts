# Scripts
Useful scripts I have written.

## Remove-AppxAllUsers
Removes Appx packages from all users. Useful to remove preinstalled versions of app, such as Skype v14.

## Rename-FileHistoryFiles
Renames files from a file history drive, e.g. `filename (timestamp).ext` to `filename.ext`. Useful if you weren't able to restore the files and you just copied them.
